# React Props & State: Lab

## Brief

Continue working on the code base from the class and attempt the following:

1. Add a new component call `AddTask` that create a new task object and add it to the array (stored in the state) in `TodoContainer`.

2. When an Add button is clicked in `AddTask` component, raise the event to `TodoContainer` so that a new task can be added to the array of tasks.

3. Write this component using the function approach instead of class.

4. Move the entire folder `todo-app` here and follow the [instruction](./README.md) to submit your lab.
